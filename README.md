# YourWear

YourWear is a static front-end web project that showcases a fashion brand concept built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed as a multi-page brand and e-commerce interface, it includes landing pages, product listings, user account flows, and interactive UI elements. The project integrates Firebase configuration files for potential backend support (authentication, database), making it a full-stack capable concept once connected to services.

## 🌟 Project Purpose

YourWear aims to provide a sleek, engaging online presence for a clothing brand. Its core goal is to offer users:
- An inviting landing page with brand vision and mission.
- A seamless browsing experience across product and informational pages.
- User entry points for login, account interaction, and form submissions.
- A structured layout that can support future backend integration.

This site is ideal for portfolios as a demonstration of front-end design skills, UI/UX structure, and progressive enhancement potential with technologies like Firebase.
